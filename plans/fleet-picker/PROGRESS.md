# Progress

**Update this whenever a task changes state.** It is the handoff between sessions.

**What the build taught lives next door in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md)** — read the rows
touching the task you pick up, and append yours there.

**Sixty words to a Notes cell, counted.** Flat prose. The cell is an index; the account is the
commit message. Whoever writes a cell also fixes the over-budget cell they walk past.

**Plan reviewed:** 2026-10-07 — 3 fixed, 3 decided with the user

**Status:** Planned. Nothing built.
**Last updated:** 2026-10-07
**Next `pir-work` will:** implement T00 (keypress-spike) if not already under way.

| # | Task | Depends on | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T00 | keypress-spike | — | ⬜ | |
| T01 | key-binding | T00 | ⬜ | |
| T02 | picker-screen | — | ✅ | One fix: picker appended no verb when its input ended (daemon waits for ever); now cancels, test locks it. Probed stdin EOF and pty close; mutated the ↑↓ toggle and the full-width `\x1b[K` skip, both red. Deviations held. That `\x1b[K` erase is the pty fake's, unverified on WezTerm. |
| T03 | daemon-picker | T00, T02 | ⬜ | |
| T04 | picker-drill | T02, T03 | ⬜ | |
| T05 | docs | T01, T03 | ⬜ | |

**Review queue:** *(empty)*

## Blocked on the user

Nothing yet. T00 needs the person at the keyboard for about a minute; T06 needs a rebuild of the
live window and approval to repoint `~/.wezterm.lua`.
