# Progress

**Update this file whenever a task changes state.** It is the handoff between sessions — a
stale tracker costs the next session more time than keeping it current ever saves.

**What the build taught lives next door, in [FINDINGS.md](FINDINGS.md)** — read the entries
that touch the task you are picking up, and append yours there. It is where "verified by hand
with the user" is written down. **Sixty words to a Notes cell here, forty to a finding
there**; when a note wants a paragraph, the paragraph belongs in the commit message.

**Status:** T05 is reviewed and done; **the whole command surface is finished and the
feature is usable end to end from a terminal**, with nothing yet drawn in the pane. That is what
T06 renders and T07 refreshes, and both are now unblocked. The review found **two defects and
fixed them**, both in lines the CLI builds itself and the model therefore never sees: untrusted
Google text (a calendar title, an account email, an error message) drew straight into the
terminal, and `agenda add __proto__` attached a calendar whose cache write silently vanished and
then killed bare `agenda`. The model's sanitiser is now **exported as `safeText`** and **T06 and
T07 must use it too** — that is the top FINDINGS row. Measured this session with outbound traffic
denied: agenda-test **579** (was 562), notes-test **39**, cockpit-test **134**, 752 assertions,
three ALL PASS. Nothing is waiting on the user.
**Last updated:** 2026-08-28
**Next `pir-work` will:** **implement T06** — the right column, NOTES over AGENDA, in
`cockpit-welcome.mjs`; `notes-test` (39) must stay green. **Read the top four FINDINGS rows
first:** sanitise everything off the wire with the model's `safeText`; `cockpit-welcome.mjs`
still has its own `clip`, which behaves differently from the model's; the scope line reads
`TODAY · Wed 26 Aug`, not the bare date its task doc draws; and a red `cockpit-test` §9d is
probably a flake, not you.

## Tasks

Legend: ⬜ not started · 🟡 in progress · 🔍 implemented, awaiting review · ✅ reviewed and
done · ⛔ blocked, needs a human.

| # | Task | Depends on | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| T00 | Can both Google accounts connect? (spike) | — | ✅ | Reviewed clean, no fix. 3 "Done when" met; probe gone, tree clean, no history traces; tests 39+108 green (untouched). Probed: 7-day expiry correctly left unverified in all 3 places; nested-JSON 🐞 routed to T04. Hand-verification is the dated FINDINGS ✅ row — reviewer can't re-run it. |
| T01 | State files, lock, atomic writes, modes | T00 | ✅ | Reviewed; **one defect fixed**: `withLock` was not reentrant, so a compound write took 5035ms *and* dropped the lock mid-transaction. Harness's real-dir and dependency guards hardened — both read stronger than they were. All four deviations approved. 60 → **65** assertions. Probed: readState never throws on junk, quarantine races, 10-way concurrency. |
| T02 | Normalise Google events; choose what shows | T00 | ✅ | Reviewed; **two defects fixed**: a `responseStatus` naming an Object property returned a *function* as `reply`, and an offset-less `dateTime` was read in the **machine's** zone — a §3.1 leak the grep cannot see. All four deviations approved. 157 → **163**. Probed: junk `now`, reversed and zero-length events, input mutation, +12:45 zones; grep re-armed by hand. |
| T03 | Draw the column | T01, T02 | ✅ | Reviewed; **three defects fixed**, all lines escaping the `rows`/`width` contract: the **header was never clipped** (over-width below 11 cols, and the sweep started at 12); **two rows could both wear `NOW`** (one Google event id spans calendars — now compared by identity); an **event title could write control sequences** into the pane (a newline painted a 7th line out of 6). All seven deviations approved. 288 → **300**. Probed: narrow widths, wrapping loud lines vs `agendaHeight`, escape smuggling. |
| T04 | Google client — OAuth, refresh, REST | T01 | ✅ | Reviewed; **two defects fixed**, both about what the user is *told*: the redirect `state` was checked only on the code branch (a stray local `?error=` ended a sign-in blaming Google for a refusal that never happened), and `describeError` dropped a scope signal `classifyError` read from the body (drawing `sign-in expired` for a consent 403). All deviations approved. 404 → **412**. Probed: browser page delivery, double redirects, junk fetch windows, malformed items, network-denied sandbox. |
| T05 | The `agenda` command | T01–T04 | ✅ | Reviewed; **two defects fixed**, both in lines the model never draws: an untrusted calendar **title escaped into the terminal** (an ESC retitled the window, a newline forged an `ls` row), and **`agenda add __proto__`** attached a calendar whose cache write vanished, then killed bare `agenda`. All eight deviations approved. 562 → **579**. Probed: hostile titles/emails/error text, prototype keys, piped-output flush, corrupt caches. |
| T06 | Right column: NOTES over AGENDA | T03, T05 | ⬜ | Touches `cockpit-welcome.mjs`; `notes-test` must stay green. |
| T07 | Daemon refresh: 60s tick + on-return | T04, T05 | ⬜ | Touches `cockpitd.mjs`; `cockpit-test` must stay green. |
| T08 | Live verification with the user; docs | T06, T07 | ⬜ | Deliverable is FINDINGS rows and docs, not code. |

**Sixty words to a Notes cell.** What was built or what the review found, the test count, and
one line per deviation from the task doc. The cell is the index; the account is the commit
message.

**Review queue:** *(empty — T06 is next, and it is an implementation.)*

## Blocked on the user

*(Empty. T00's hand-verification is recorded in FINDINGS 2026-08-27, T05's in FINDINGS
2026-08-28. Nothing waiting.)*

The user's `~/.claude/cockpit/bin/agenda` symlink was created by hand for that check; every
cockpit rebuild relinks it anyway, so there is nothing to undo.

Left for the user's own machine, on their own schedule, not blocking anything: the probe's
`~/.claude/cockpit/probe-client.json` can stay (T04 reuses the same registration) or be
removed. Whether *Testing*'s refresh token still works in a week is the one open question, and
DESIGN §2.9 already handles either answer.
